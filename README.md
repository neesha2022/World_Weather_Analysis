-filter the data for weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 
-from the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary.
-finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, ycreate a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
